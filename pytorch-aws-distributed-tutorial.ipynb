    "## Amazon AWS Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will run distributed training across two multi-gpu nodes. In this section we will first cover how to create the nodes, then how to setup the security group so the nodes can communicate with eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Amazon AWS, there are seven steps to creating an instance. To get started, login and select **Launch Instance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** - Here we will select the `Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 14.0`. As described, this instance comes with many of the most popular deep learning frameworks installed and is preconfigured with CUDA, cuDNN, and NCCL. It is a very good starting point for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Choose an Instance Type** - Now, select the GPU compute unit called `p2.8xlarge`. Notice, each of these instances has a different cost but this instance provides 8 NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs per node, and provides a good architecture for multi-gpu distributed \n",
    "training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Configure Instance Details** - The only setting to change here is increasing the *Number of instances* to 2. All other configurations may be left at default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Add Storage** - Notice, by default these nodes do not come with a lot of storage (only 75 GB). For this tutorial, since we are only using the STL-10 dataset, this is plenty of storage. But, if you want to train on a larger dataset such as ImageNet, you will have to add much more storage just to fit the dataset and any trained models you wish to save.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Add Tags** - Nothing to be done here, just move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Configure Security Group** - This is a critical step in the configuration process. By default two nodes in the same security group would not be able to communicate in the distributed training setting. Here, we want to create a **new** security group for the two nodes to be in. However, we cannot finish configuring in this step. For now, just remember your new security group name (e.g. launch-wizard-12) then move on to Step 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7: Review Instance Launch** - Here, review the instance then launch it. By default, this will automatically start initializing the two instances. You can monitor the initialization progress from the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure Security Group\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we were not able to properly configure the security group when creating the instances. Once you have launched the instance, select the *Network & Security > Security Groups* tab in the EC2 dashboard. This will bring up a list of security groups you have access to. Select the new security group you created in Step 6 (i.e. launch-wizard-12), which will bring up tabs called *Description, Inbound, Outbound, and Tags*. First, select the *Inbound* tab and *Edit* to add a rule to allow \"All Traffic\" from \"Sources\" in the launch-wizard-12 security group. Then select the *Outbound* tab and do the exact same thing. Now, we have effectively allowed all Inbound and Outbound traffic of all types between nodes in the launch-wizard-12 security group. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Necessary Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing, we must find and remember the IP addresses of both nodes. In the EC2 dashboard find your running instances. For both instances, write down the *IPv4 Public IP* and the *Private IPs*. For the remainder of the document, we will refer to these as the **node0-publicIP**, **node0-privateIP**, **node1-publicIP**, and **node1-privateIP**. The public IPs are the addresses we will use to SSH in, and the private IPs will be used for inter-node communication."

    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The next critical step is the setup of each node. Unfortunately, we cannot configure both nodes at the same time, so this process must be done on each node separately. However, this is a one time setup, so once you have the nodes configured properly you will not have to reconfigure for future distributed training projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step, once logged onto the node, is to create a new conda environment with python 3.6 and numpy. Once created activate the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda create -n nightly_pt python=3.6 numpy\n",
    "$ source activate nightly_pt\n",
    "``` \n",
    "    \n",
    "Next, we will install a nightly build of Cuda 9.0 enabled PyTorch with pip in the conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ pip install torch_nightly -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu90/torch_nightly.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We must also install torchvision so we can use the torchvision model and dataset. At this time, we must build torchvision from source as the pip installation will by default install an old version of PyTorch on top of the nightly build we just installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cd\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/pytorch/vision.git\n",
    "$ cd vision\n",
    "$ python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, **VERY IMPORTANT** step is to set the network interface name for the NCCL socket. This is set with the environment variable `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME`. To get the correct name, run the `ifconfig` command on the node and look at the interface name that corresponds to the node's *privateIP* (e.g. ens3). Then set the environment variable as\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=ens3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, do this on both nodes. You may also consider adding the NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME setting to your *.bashrc*. An important observation is that we did not setup a shared filesystem between the nodes. Therefore, each node will have to have a copy of the code and a copy of the datasets. For more information about setting up a shared network filesystem between nodes, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elastic-file-system-shared-file-storage-for-amazon-ec2/). "

    "## Distributed Training Code\n",
    "\n",
    "With the instances running and the environments setup we can now get into the training code. Most of the code here has been taken from the [PyTorch ImageNet Example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet) which also supports distributed training. This code provides a good starting point for a custom trainer as it has much of the boilerplate training loop, validation loop, and accuracy tracking functionality. However, you will notice that the argument parsing and other non-essential functions have been stripped out for simplicity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will use [torchvision.models.resnet18](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html#torchvision.models.resnet18) model and will train it on the [torchvision.datasets.STL10](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.STL10) dataset. To accomodate for the dimensionality mismatch of STL-10 with Resnet18, we will resize each image to 224x224 with a transform. Notice, the choice of model and dataset are orthogonal to the distributed training code, you may use any dataset and model you wish and the process is the same. Lets get started by first handling the imports and talking about some helper functions. Then we will define the train and test functions, which have been largely taken from the ImageNet Example. At the end, we will build the main part of the code which handles the distributed training setup. And finally, we will discuss how to actually run the code."

An *init_method* input which is either a url containing the address and port of the rank0 machine or a path to a non-existant file on the shared file system. Note, to use the file init_method, all machines must have access to the file, similarly for the url method, all machines must be able to communicate on the network so make sure to configure any firewalls and network settings to accomodate.

For example, if you have two nodes, each with 8 GPUs and you wish to train with all of them then $world\\_size=16$ and each node will have a process with local rank 0-7. This local_rank is used to set the device (i.e. which GPU to use) for the process and later used to set the device when creating a distributed data parallel model. It is also recommended to use NCCL backend in this hypothetical environment as NCCL is preferred for multi-gpu nodes."

The STL10 dataset is a 10 class dataset of 96x96px color images. For use with our model, we resize the images to 224x224px in the transform. One distributed training specific item in this section is the use of the `DistributedSampler` for the training set, which is designed to be used in conjunction with `DistributedDataParallel` models. This object handles the partitioning of the dataset across the distributed environment so that not all models are training on the same subset of data, which would be counterproductive. Finally, we create the `DataLoader`'s which are responsible for feeding the data to the processes.\n",

After updating the sampler, the loop runs a full training epoch, runs a full validation step then prints the performance of the current model against the best performing model so far. After training for num_epochs, the loop exits and the tutorial is complete. Notice, since this is an exercise we are not saving models but one may wish to keep track of the best performing model then save it at the end of training (see [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py#L184))."
